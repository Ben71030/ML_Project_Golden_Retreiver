# Machine_Learning_Project_Golden_Retrievers
Anwar Benmallouk and Monte Fernandez
The goal of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict if a golden retrievers has a parasite or not. The data set we use to create the models is on the blood composition of golden retrievers and other characteristics, which is under the file "CBC_data.csv". We used three different algorithms to create the models, which were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
